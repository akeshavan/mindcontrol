  <h6>RESEARCHER’S STATEMENT:</h6>
<p>  We are asking you to be in a research study.  The purpose of this consent form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not.  Please read the form carefully.  You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. Please email keshavan@uw.edu if you have any questions. When we have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not.  This process is called “informed consent.”
</p>
  <h6>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h6>
  <p>Image annotation is needed to extract data from images. The purpose of this study is to train better computer algorithms to annotate images, and also correct any errors the computer makes.  In particular, we aim to train you to accurately annotate images through a game. We aim to 1) collect image annotation data from you, 2) track how quickly and accurately you learn to annotate images, and 3) combine annotations from many users into the most accurate annotation. This information will be used to train new computer algorithms.
    </p>
  <h6>STUDY PROCEDURES</h6>

  <p>You will be asked to log in. You may use an existing social media login (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc.), and you may be asked to create a nickname. You may also choose to include your social media avatar to display alongside your nickname in the public leaderboard. Alternatively, you may also have the option to use an anonymous login, but you may not have access to your scores in the future.
    </p>
  <p>You will be given instructions on how to annotate images for a particular task. Try your best to annotate the images as quickly and accurately as you can. You may complete however many tasks you wish. Each task can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. You may stop playing at any time.
    </p>
  <p>You may use any device with a web browser (computer, tablet, or phone). We will record all settings you use on the application, your annotations, your screen resolution, and your nickname. This data will be made publically available to researchers.
    </p>
  <h6>RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT</h6>
  <p>Some people feel that providing information for research or having the research session recorded is an invasion of privacy. If you wish to remain anonymous, we recommend creating an anonymous nickname that does not include any identifiers relating to you.
    </p>
  <h6>BENEFITS OF THE STUDY</h6>
  <p>This study will help us to extract accurate data from images. This information will be used for scientific research.
    </p>

  <h6>CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION</h6>
  <p>Your social media login information (such as username and email address) will remain confidential and will not be shared outside the study team.
  Government or university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally.  If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined.  The reviewers will protect your privacy.  The study records will not be used to put you at legal risk of harm.
    </p>
  <h6>RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY</h6>
  <p>If you think you have been harmed from being in this research, contact Anisha Keshavan at <a href="#">keshavan@uw.edu.</a>
    </p>
  <p>* Please note that we cannot ensure the confidentiality of information sent via e-mail.
    </p>
  <h6>SUBJECT’S STATEMENT</h6>
  <p>This study has been explained to me, and I understand the procedures, benefits, and risks of this study.  I affirm that I am capable of consenting on my own behalf, that I am age 18 or older, and I volunteer to take part in this research.  I have had a chance to ask questions.  If I have questions later about the research, or if I have been harmed by participating in this study, I can contact one of the researchers listed on the first page of this consent form.  If I have questions about my rights as a research subject, I can call the Human Subjects Division at (206) 543-0098 or email hsdinfo@uw.edu.
