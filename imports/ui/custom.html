    <h1>Healthy Brain Network: Quality Control</h1>
    <p class="lead">Are you interested in studying pediatric mental health? Help us analyze the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/06/13/149369">Healthy Brain Network dataset!</a></p>
    <p> We want to measure the volumes of various structures in the brain with
      automated algorithms (such as <a href="http://www.mindboggle.info/index.html"> Klein et al., 2017</a>, <a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">Fischl et al., 2002</a>, and <a href="http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/">Avants et al., 2014</a>).
      But some of the scans are very bad quality and would yield incorrect results. We need to identify these scans so we don't analyze them. </p>

          <div class="panel-body">
            Here are some reasons a scan might fail quality control:

            <h3>Motion</h3>
            <p class="lead"> Scans with too much motion cannot be segmented </p>
            <p> The image below shows varying amounts of motion artifacts (you can see bands on the images). Images with too much motion cannot be automatically segmented because its too difficult to see the boundaries between tissues. </p>
            <img src="/motion_QC.png" width="100%"/>
            <p class="center-block muted" style="text-align: center"><small>Figure 3: Four images with varying levels on motion (banding artifacts). Image on the left has many artifacts, and it is difficult to delineate tissue types. Motion guidelines are adapted from <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/33/9357.full.pdf?with-ds=yes">(Walhovd et al., 2016)</a></small></p>

            <p> If you are not sure how to rate a scan with motion, give your rating a low confidence score (a 1 or 2). Don't worry if you are wrong, we will be averaging ratings across many raters.</p>

            <h3>Other Artifacts</h3>
            <p class="lead"> Shift + Click to annotate slices or regions of the image that are low quality </p>
            <p> Sometimes artifacts are only on a few slices. Annotate these slices so we know where they are:</p>
            <img src="/badQ.png" width="75%" class="center-block" />
            <p class="center-block muted" style="text-align: center"><small>Figure 4: Three examples showing images with artifacts only on a few slices. The image on the right shows a defacing error in the frontal lobe.</small></p>

            <p> The red dots on the image above show the annotations in regions of noise. Scroll through the entire brain when you QC, and watch out for bad defacing in the frontal lobes.</p>

            <h3>Abnormal Geometry</h3>
            <p class="lead"> Automated segmentation might fail on abnormal geometry </p>
            <p>The images below show brains with abnormal geometry, such as cysts or abnormally large ventricles. Automated segmentations might fail on these scans, so we need to be warned ahead of time.</p>
            <img src="/textAnnot.png" width="75%" class="center-block" />
            <p class="center-block muted" style="text-align: center"><small>Figure 5: Three examples of scans with good quality but abnormal geometry </small></p>

            <p> Pass the image if its quality is good, but remember to write a note (in the notes section) about any abnormal geometry or incidental findings. </p>

    Our goal is first finish rating all images with the <a class=" label label-warning filter T1w+average_vote+undefined">Not Rated</a> tag in the tables below.
     Click on the <a class=" label label-warning filter T1w+average_vote+undefined">Not Rated</a> tag to filter the table to only show scans that haven't been rated yet.

  <h6>RESEARCHER’S STATEMENT:</h6>
<p>  We are asking you to be in a research study.  The purpose of this consent form is to give you the information you will need to help you decide whether to be in the study or not.  Please read the form carefully.  You may ask questions about the purpose of the research, what we would ask you to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research or this form that is not clear. Please email keshavan@uw.edu if you have any questions. When we have answered all your questions, you can decide if you want to be in the study or not.  This process is called “informed consent.”
</p>
  <h6>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</h6>
  <p>Image annotation is needed to extract data from images. The purpose of this study is to train better computer algorithms to annotate images, and also correct any errors the computer makes.  In particular, we aim to train you to accurately annotate images through a game. We aim to 1) collect image annotation data from you, 2) track how quickly and accurately you learn to annotate images, and 3) combine annotations from many users into the most accurate annotation. This information will be used to train new computer algorithms.
    </p>
  <h6>STUDY PROCEDURES</h6>

  <p>You will be asked to log in. You may use an existing social media login (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc.), and you may be asked to create a nickname. You may also choose to include your social media avatar to display alongside your nickname in the public leaderboard. Alternatively, you may also have the option to use an anonymous login, but you may not have access to your scores in the future.
    </p>
  <p>You will be given instructions on how to annotate images for a particular task. Try your best to annotate the images as quickly and accurately as you can. You may complete however many tasks you wish. Each task can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. You may stop playing at any time.
    </p>
  <p>You may use any device with a web browser (computer, tablet, or phone). We will record all settings you use on the application, your annotations, your screen resolution, and your nickname. This data will be made publically available to researchers.
    </p>
  <h6>RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT</h6>
  <p>Some people feel that providing information for research or having the research session recorded is an invasion of privacy. If you wish to remain anonymous, we recommend creating an anonymous nickname that does not include any identifiers relating to you.
    </p>
  <h6>BENEFITS OF THE STUDY</h6>
  <p>This study will help us to extract accurate data from images. This information will be used for scientific research.
    </p>

  <h6>CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESEARCH INFORMATION</h6>
  <p>Your social media login information (such as username and email address) will remain confidential and will not be shared outside the study team.
  Government or university staff sometimes review studies such as this one to make sure they are being done safely and legally.  If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined.  The reviewers will protect your privacy.  The study records will not be used to put you at legal risk of harm.
    </p>
  <h6>RESEARCH-RELATED INJURY</h6>
  <p>If you think you have been harmed from being in this research, contact Anisha Keshavan at <a href="#">keshavan@uw.edu.</a>
    </p>
  <p>* Please note that we cannot ensure the confidentiality of information sent via e-mail.

  <h6>SUBJECT’S STATEMENT</h6>
  <p>This study has been explained to me, and I understand the procedures, benefits, and risks of this study.  I affirm that I am capable of consenting on my own behalf, that I am age 18 or older, and I volunteer to take part in this research.  I have had a chance to ask questions.  If I have questions later about the research, or if I have been harmed by participating in this study, I can contact one of the researchers listed on the first page of this consent form.  If I have questions about my rights as a research subject, I can call the Human Subjects Division at (206) 543-0098 or email hsdinfo@uw.edu.
